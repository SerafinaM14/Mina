    <h1>Mina The Ladybug</h1>
    <h2>By Serafina Muniz</h2>
    <p>This story follows a Ladybug named Mina and the obstacles she faces that prevent her from satisfying her hunger. After waking up from her fall hibernation, we accompany Mina in her journey of perseverance. I made this story because it's normal to struggle and face obstacles to achieve your desires. However, either by chance or dedication, it can be achieved.</p>
